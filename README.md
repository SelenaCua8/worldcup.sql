Worldcup SQL Project 🏆🛢️
This project, worldcup.sql, was created as part of the FreeCodeCamp Relational Database Certification.
It involves practicing SQL queries, database design, and data manipulation related to a World Cup dataset. 📚⚽
The project helped me strengthen my understanding of relational databases and SQL commands.

Thank you for visiting! 🙌
